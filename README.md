# Forum done in JavaServer Pages

This “Forum” was an exam assignment, subject Internet Programming. 
I might add that it was first time for me to tackle with IP in general, so starting experience I gained from this was immense.

I’ve used JSP, not because we were limited, but because I’ve seen it as an opportunity to learn, at that moment for me, hardest MVC model available. 

Written using Eclipse Mars IDE. XAMP suite as an easy server-db-gui local setup.
In each segment that could confuse, I’ve provided README doc.

If I ever go over this project again, I’ll add comments in English, and provide better readMe.
Plus, this project was meant to teach myself backend, not frontend. So, I do apologize for noobish design.

Peace ^_^
